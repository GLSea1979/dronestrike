          <li><p style="text-indent: 20px;">The data represented in the graphs and then visibly shown on the map is drone strikes by the US military ranging from 2002 up until present day.
          </p></li><br>
          <li><p style="text-indent: 20px;"> With the data we have, the origin of the strikes is in the middle east; specific countries being Yemen, Pakistan, and Somalia.

          </p></li><br>
          <li><p style="text-indent: 20px;">The map is responsive and you are able to click on a country and see more in depth of the specific strikes. The markers show each US drone strikes with details of dates, fatalities, and even names.

          </p></li><br>
          <li><p style="text-indent: 20px;">Understandably enough, it is not possible to tell exactly who is in the strike zone outside of the targeted individuals. Unfortunately, many young children and innocent people are victims of these attacks.
